# Beer Personalization and Recommendation System

## Background
For this project, we pretend to be an online craft beer retailer. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that generates purchase recommendations for our customers when they visit our website. The recommendations should take into account the customerâ€™s taste and preferences while helping them discover new beers they have not tried before. For each user, we provide up to 10 beer recommendations each time they visit our website.

## Challenges
Our project focuses on tackling the following challenges:
1. How can we build recommendations that take into account user preferences and taste?
2. How do we ensure that there is enough variety among the set of beers that are recommended during each user session?
3. How do we encourage users to explore beers/styles that they have not tried before - either because they are newly released items (not many reviews) or because they are a different type than the one usually consumed by the user? (serendipitous recommendations/novelty items)
4. How do we provide recommendations for users that just joined the service? (cold start problem)

## Project in Abstract
1. Exploratory Data Analysis of BeerAdvocate dataset
2. Implementation and training of different algorithms (SVD , NMF, KNN and NLP Content based model(CBM)) across user subgroups.
3. Model Evaluation based on accuracy
4. Variety and Serendipity evaluation
5. Tackling the Cold Start Problem
